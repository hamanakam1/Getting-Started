#### Markdown 

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

   * Gists
   * Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
   * Files with the .md or .markdown extension

### Syntax guide

Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

### Headers

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

### Emphasis

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

### Lists

## Unordered

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2.1
  * Item 2.2

## Ordered

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3.1
   1. Item 3.2

### Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

### Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
